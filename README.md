## About the Repository  
Welcome to **PyDSA**, a curated compendium of Data Structures and Algorithms meticulously articulated in the versatile language of Python.  
This repository is not a mere aggregation of codes, it is a pedagogical journey designed to illuminate the logic, elegance, and intellectual satisfaction that accompany well-crafted algorithms.  

---

## What You’ll Find Here  
- **Foundational Concepts** – from recursion to iteration, unravelled with crystalline clarity.  
- **Classic Problems** – factorials, Fibonacci, search and sort, each elucidated with rigor.  
- **Algorithmic Patterns** – the paradigms of divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods.  
- **Readable Notebooks** – every `.ipynb` file intersperses code with lucid commentary and complexity analysis.
